# building-dataset
In the absence of datasets for building object detection tasks in remote sensing imagery, representative cities such as Hangzhou and Nanchang were selected as target acquisition areas. The raw data source utilizes Level 20 satellite imagery from the ArcGIS Imagery remote sensing data source within SAS.Planet software, featuring a spatial resolution of 0.27 meters and image dimensions of 512Ã—512 pixels. LabelImg software was employed to annotate building objects within the images using horizontal rectangular bounding boxes.
